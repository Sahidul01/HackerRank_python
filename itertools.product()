This tool computes the cartesian product of input iterables.
It is equivalent to nested for-loops.
For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B

Task

You are given a two lists
and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X

.

Example

A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

Note:
and

are sorted lists, and the cartesian product's tuples should be output in sorted order.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of list
.
The second line contains the space separated elements of list

.

Both lists have no duplicate integer elements.

Constraints


Output Format

Output the space separated tuples of the cartesian product.

Sample Input

 1 2
 3 4

Sample Output

 (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)
